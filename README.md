# ITA-Hackathon-24
This is a mental health chatbot that provides the user with breathing exercises , quotes and mental health tips based on the user's mood.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used through:**

1. Keyword Matching
The chatbot uses basic keyword matching to determine the user's intent. This is a rudimentary form of NLP. The chatbot looks for specific keywords or phrases in the user input to decide how to respond. For example:

"sad" triggers a response related to sadness.
"quote" triggers a response with a motivational quote.
"breathe" triggers instructions for a breathing exercise.

2. Case Insensitivity
To make keyword matching more robust, the input is converted to lowercase using input.toLowerCase(). This ensures that the bot can correctly match keywords regardless of how the user capitalizes them.

3. Response Generation
Based on the identified keywords, the chatbot generates predefined responses. This is a basic form of response generation where the chatbot selects an appropriate response from a set of options based on the user's input.
